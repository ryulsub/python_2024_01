On Monday, OpenAI, the artificial intelligence startup behind viral chatbot ChatGPT, 
clapped back at The New York Times in a statement over the news outlet’s recently filed lawsuit over copyright infringement.
In December, The New York Times filed a lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI,
alleging intellectual property violations related to its journalistic content appearing in ChatGPT training data. 
According to a filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, 
the Times seeks to hold Microsoft and OpenAI accountable for “billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages” 
related to the “unlawful copying and use of The Times’s uniquely valuable works.”
